        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p><img src="johncc.png"></p>
        
      <center><p>My name is John. I am a survivor of traumatic abuse within the public school system. I am a former special education student at Aiken County Public Schools. I was degraded, humiliated, and assaulted inside of these schools. While I was in the public school system I recieved CONSTANT abuse. I have been placed in seclusion rooms, restrained and I have even been jumped by an entire class. The school district forced me to be in a room with gang members, sexual predators, an violent criminals. All while knowing that I was a non-violent person with no extreme behavioral issues. They did not document my abuse, Nor did they document how many times they had locked me in a seclusion room. They covered up the evidence and they lied about it! Every day I feared for my life. Teachers and staff working at these schools did nothing to protect me from harm and even encouraged the abuse.</p></center>
      <center><p>These schools made a promise to me that I would have my diploma after everything I went through and they lied to me! What is even worse is I found out that they make money off of placing children in special education classes and claiming that they have special needs. They get THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. To make matters worse, I didn't belong in special ed. THEY LABELED ME A SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENT TO COLLECT YOUR TAX MONEY FOLKS! They kept me in special ed not becuase I needed it but because they were reciving money from the federal goverment. They left me there, USING ME FOR THEIR FUNDING. It ties in to BIG PHARMA. They refer us to doctors and give us diagnosis and they put us on mood altering drugs like ritalin. THEY RUIN OUR MINDS AND OUR LIVES! AND THEY ALL MAKE MONEY FROM IT!</center>
      
      </p> 
      <p>IT IS A HUGE SCAM! AND NO-ONE IS EDUCATING THE PUBLIC ABOUT THIS! </p>
     <center> <p>IMAGINE HOW MANY KIDS HAVE BEEN HURT BY THIS SYSTEM...Now imagine how many of those kids could become school shooters....Yeah, you are starting to see my point now huh?</p></center>
     <center> <p>GUYS. THEY ARE RUNNING <span style="color: #ff0000">MK-ULTRA</span> LIKE <span style="color: #ff0000">MIND CONTROL</span> PROGRAMS OUT OF OUR <span style="color: #ff0000">PUBLIC SCHOOLS</span>!</p>
      <p>They never intended to educate or help us. They just harrassed and belittled us all day long!</p>
      <p>If you look into <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_torture">White Room Torture</a></p>
        You will learn that it is a TORTURE technique used by our intelligence agencies for dealing with <span style="color: #ff0000">terrorists, prisoners, and violent psychopaths.</span></p>
        <p>But...</p>
        <p><span style="color: #ff0000">THEY WERE USING THIS TORTURE METHOD ON CHILDREN!</span></p>
      <p>THEY USED TORTURE TECHNIQUES ON ME. THEY USED IT ON US.</p>
      <p>I am a real person. I have a name and a story. YOU WILL NOT COVER UP MY ABUSE AND GASLIGHT ME ANYMORE! AND YOU WILL NOT CONTINUE TO USE THE MESSED UP PAST YOU ALL CREATED TO PUT ME AWAY AND MAKE ME LOOK CRAZY!</p></center>
      <center><span style="color: #ff0000">TELL ME AIKEN COUNTY! WHERE IS THE FUTURE THAT YOU PROMISED ME</span>? WAS IT ALL A LIE?</center>
      <center> <p><span style="color: #ff0000">No Child Left Behind/No Man Left Behind The Uninted States Black Budget Program to create future soldiers in a public school setting is real. They are training children to be violent killers. Even if you don't want to believe it's real, it doesn't change that it is exactly what they did and are doing now.</span> </p></center>
      <center>I have been diagnosed with PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) by a licenced heathcare proffessional. That's right. I got PTSD from what they did to me. I re-live my traumatic experiences every day. BUT I WILL NOT GIVE UP!</center></section>

        <h2>The Truth</h2>
<p>This happens. It's going on. Everyone saw it happen to me and they chose to do nothing!</p>
<section>


</section>
<center> 
  This is EXACTLY how they treated me!
  I wasn't acting out! 
  <p>I did NOTHING to deserve it other than voicing my opinion.</p>

Now what if this was your child? Would it change anything?
  <p><img src="whatif.png"></p>
  <p> People make choices. You have a choice. You can ignore it all- write it off as crazy, or you can create change and be a voice to those who can't be heard.</p>

  <p> WHERE DID THESE ABUSES TAKE PLACE?:</p>
  There are two locations.
<p> 100 Bears Rock Rd, Aiken, SC 29801</p>
<p>224 Kershaw St NE, Aiken, SC 29801 </p>
